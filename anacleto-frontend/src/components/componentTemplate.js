/*
	Component Memoization
	Prevent the Component from re-rendering multiple times if not necessary.

	When a re-render is expected, React checks the actually rendered props of a component and the new props passed by the re-render event, as well as comparing the rendered DOM tree with the one that should be rendered.
	
	By default, React performs a shallow comparison of all the props, and this might trigger re-renders even if the props haven't changed (functions are always considered as new props).

	Checking the DOM trees is also a "slow" process, especially for bigger components.

	The function below should prevent unnecessary re-renders by comparing previous props and next props ONLY for the props specified in the PropTypes, from this the necessity of exhaustive PropTypes definition.

	This also skips DOM trees comparison, making the process faster as it's definitely faster to compare object keys rather than DOM trees.

	The default function should suffice for most cases, but can be customized for special cases.
	It just needs to return a boolean value where
	"true" tells React to NOT re-render the component (no "important" props have changed)
	"false" tells React to re-render the component (something "important" changed and component should be re-rendered)
